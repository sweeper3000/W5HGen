# W5HGen
A python script to help you create a list for W5H: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How

Needs to be run with python3

## Usage
The program will start by asking for the filename. It will be called `w5h-fileName.txt`. 

The program asks for the title of the document. It will be in all caps no matter the input as it is run through `upper()`.

The program will be asking for `who`, `what`, `when`, `where,` `why` and `how`, stored under variables of the same name.

The program then creates a file based on the filename you helped construct earlier. It will write the title, and the content of the variables, preceded by the actual variable name in capitals. That is constant.

## Verify
Each release will have the SHA-256 checksum of the `W5HGen.py` file. There will be a hash for every git tag.
